TYPES

type InternalQuery struct {
	Field        string
	Vector       []float32
	Base64Vector string

	NumCandidates *uint32
	Boost         *float32
	Prefilter     search.Query
}
    InternalQuery is used for internal functionality. Internal: This should
    never be used and is not supported.

func (q InternalQuery) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
    MarshalJSON marshal's this query to JSON for the search REST API.

func (q InternalQuery) Validate() error
    Validate verifies that settings in the query are valid.

type InternalSearch struct {
	Queries []InternalQuery

	VectorQueryCombination VectorQueryCombination
}
    InternalSearch is used for internal functionality. Internal: This should
    never be used and is not supported.

func (s InternalSearch) Validate() error
    Validate verifies that settings in the search (including all queries) are
    valid.

type Query struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Query specifies a vector Query.

func NewBase64Query(vectorFieldName string, base64Vector string) *Query
    NewBase64Query constructs a new vector Query using a Base64-encoded sequence
    of little-endian IEEE 754 floats.

func NewQuery(vectorFieldName string, vector []float32) *Query
    NewQuery constructs a new vector Query.

func (q *Query) Boost(boost float32) *Query
    Boost specifies the boost for this query.

func (q *Query) Internal() InternalQuery
    Internal is used for internal functionality. Internal: This should never be
    used and is not supported.

func (q *Query) NumCandidates(num uint32) *Query
    NumCandidates controls how many results are returned for this query.

func (q *Query) Prefilter(query search.Query) *Query
    Prefilter specifies a search.Query to filter by before executing the query.

type Search struct {
	// Has unexported fields.
}
    Search specifies a vector Search.

func NewSearch(queries []*Query, opts *SearchOptions) *Search
    NewSearch constructs a new vector Search.

func (s *Search) Internal() InternalSearch
    Internal is used for internal functionality. Internal: This should never be
    used and is not supported.

type SearchOptions struct {
	VectorQueryCombination VectorQueryCombination
}
    SearchOptions specifies the options available to vector Search.

type VectorQueryCombination string
    VectorQueryCombination specifies how elements in the array are combined.

const (
	VectorQueryCombinationNotSet VectorQueryCombination = ""
	VectorQueryCombinationAnd    VectorQueryCombination = "and"
	VectorQueryCombinationOr     VectorQueryCombination = "or"
)
